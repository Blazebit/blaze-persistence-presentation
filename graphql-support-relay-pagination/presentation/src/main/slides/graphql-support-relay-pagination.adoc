== What's GraphQL

[, https://graphql.org/]
""
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
""

image::graphql_logo.svg[float="right",width="170px"]

Originated at Facebook and moved to foundation part of Linux foundation

<<<

* It's a typed language, so one needs to define a schema
* Schema allows for tools like GraphiQL which should convince schema haters

pass:[<br>]

* Goals
** Eliminate over or under-fetching
** Allow declarative type-checkable querying
** Support for schema evolution
** Increase productivity and performance

<<<

Schema

[source,graphql]
----
type Query {
    catById(id: ID!): CatWithOwnerView
}
type CatWithOwnerView {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    owner: PersonSimpleView!
}
type PersonSimpleView {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
}
----

Query

[source,graphql, role = 'mapping-right']
----
query {
    catById(id: 1) {
        name
        owner {
            name
        }
    }
}
----
|===

<<<

* Define elements you need in structured way based on schema
* Result payload is JSON according to schema structure

[source]
----
{
    catById: {
        name: "Cat 1"
        owner: {
            name: "Owner 1"
        }
    }
}
----

== GraphQL type system

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
* Object types - keyword `type`
* Interface types - keyword `interface`
* Union types - keyword `union`
* Enum types - keyword `enum`
* Lists - denoted with `[]`

|
* Scalars
** `String`
** `Float`
** `Int`
** `Boolean`
** `ID`
** Custom e.g. `Date`
|===

== Other operations

[cols="a,a"]
|===
|
Mutation

[source,graphql]
----
mutation {
    createCat(name: "New Cat") {
        id
        name
    }
}
----

|
Subscription

[source,graphql, role = 'mapping-right']
----
subscription {
    onCreate {
        id
        name
    }
}
----
|===

* Mutation is like POST/PUT i.e. a modification operation
* Subscription is like a listener for changes

[%step]
* But focus in this presentation is on queries

== Traditional REST design

* Create endpoint for every entity type to list or access by id
* Mirrors the normalized database design and is easy to implement
* Providing relationship data is rarely done, often only id available
* Leads to inefficient lookups done by client, maybe even N + 1 issues
* Data aggregation/composition is done by client in waterfall manner
* Client might have bad reception, so subsequent requests might fail

pass:[<br>]

* `/cats` returns list of cats, but only with owner ids
* `/cats/{id}` returns details of cat and also owner name
* `/person/{id}` returns details of person

== GraphQL access design

* Single endpoint for querying data `/graphql`
* Schema based querying to get only needed data in structured form
* GraphQL can be used as API gateway to reduce client latency at first
* Querying all at once can improve query and overall performance a lot
* But you can still stick to traditional REST design behind the scenes
* Subscriptions as a way to show live data
* Transport agnostic, so it doesn't have to be executed through HTTP, it's just a string

== GraphQL features

* Aliases allow to fetch multiple object graphs at once and assign a name

* Recent idea that came up, allow passing ids and versions of locally cached values to server
* Server can skip returning the full state of objects and maybe skip fetching data conditionally

== Possible misconceptions about GraphQL

* GraphQL does *not* require a specific database like e.g. graph database
* GraphQL is *not* tied to specific frameworks/languages
* GraphQL is *not* going to allow executing arbitrary SQL
* GraphQL is a specification language for communication, not a library or storage system
* Using GraphQL through HTTP allows to reuse existing security integrations e.g. OAuth

[%step]
* So dont' be shy and give it a try!

== Pagination with GraphQL and Relay spec

image::relay.svg[float="right",width="170px"]

* Relay is a JavaScript framework by Facebook
* The interesting part is, it has a specification for cursor based pagination

[source,graphql]
----
query {
  findAll(first: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    pageInfo {
      startCursor
      endCursor
    }
  }
}
----

<<<

* Fetches first 10 nodes and delivers cursors of the start and end element

[source]
----
{
  findAll: {
    edges: [{
      node: {
        id: 1
        name: "..."
      }, ...
    }]
    pageInfo: {
      startCursor: "..."
      endCursor: "..."
    }
  }
}
----

Specification: https://facebook.github.io/relay/graphql/connections.htm

<<<

* Use `endCursor` from previous response as argument for `after`

[source,graphql]
----
query {
  findAll(first: 10, after: "...") {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    pageInfo {
      startCursor
      endCursor
    }
  }
}
----

== What does the Relay specification define?

* Relay spec defines the types `Node` and `PageInfo`
* User object types should implement the `Node` interface
* A type with name ending with `Connection` e.g. `CatWithOwnerConnection`
** Must have `pageInfo: PageInfo!`
** Must have `edges: [CatWithOwnerEdge]`
* A type with name ending with `Edge` e.g. `CatWithOwnerEdge`
** Must have `node: CatWithOwnerNode`
** Must have `cursor: String!`
* Field returning a `Connection` must accept `before` and `after` arguments
* Must also accept `first` and `last` for specifying amount of elements

== Implementing Relay types for a small model by hand

[source,graphql]
----
type Query {
  findAll(first: Int, last: Int, before: String, after: String): CatWithOwnerViewConnection!
}
type PageInfo {
  startCursor: String
  endCursor: String
}
type CatWithOwnerViewConnection {
  edges: [CatWithOwnerViewEdge]
  pageInfo: PageInfo
}
type CatWithOwnerViewEdge {
  node: CatWithOwnerViewNode!
  cursor: String!
}
type CatWithOwnerViewNode {
  id: ID!
  ...
}
----

<<<

* That's a lot of schema one has to define for getting the standard right
* Writing the schema is one part, but keeping up-to-date and in-sync with model is also hard
* How to implement `before` and `after` with cursors?
** Serialize offset, limit and id to Base64 and re-execute with `id > after`?
** Serialize keyset to Base64 and implement proper keyset pagination?

[%step]
* Doing that manually requires quite some work!

pass:[<br>]

[%step]
* Blaze-Persistence Entity View integration with GraphQL comes to the rescue!

== What is Blaze-Persistence

image::logo.png[role="logo"]

* Library that builds on top of JPA with deep integration
* Fluent builder API that is easy to use
* Rich pagination support integrated
* Advanced SQL support on top of JPA model
** SET operations (`UNION`, `INTERSECT`, etc.)
** CTEs and recursive CTEs (`WITH` clause)
** `RETURNING` clause support
** `VALUES` clause and much more!

== What is Blaze-Persistence Entity Views

image::dto-mapping.png[role="logo"]

Entity Views are the ORM equivalent of database views

* Built on top of Blaze-Persistence Core
* Define how DTO maps to entity via JPQL.next expressions
* Querying only the parts you need reduces data transfer
* Flushing only the parts that may change helps as well

Some example use cases:

* Display data in UI
* Fetch data to be returned in REST resources
* Define updatable attributes per use case

== Example View - Basic

Entity views are projections of entities

@Entity
public class Cat {
    @Id
    Integer id;
    String name;
    Integer age;
    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    Cat mother;
    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    Cat father;
    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    Person owner;
    @OneToMany
    Set<Cat> kittens;
}
----

|[source,java, role = 'mapping-right basic-mapping-1-2']
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
public interface CatView {

    @IdMapping
    Integer getId();

    String getName();

    @Mapping("LOWER(name)")
    String getLowerCaseName();

    @Mapping("SIZE(kittens)")
    Integer getNumKittens();

}

})("basic-mapping-1");

== Entity Views and GraphQL

* GraphQL more or less requires us to define DTOs
* Blaze-Persistence Entity Views is a technology to implement the DTO pattern
* So let's reuse these DTO definitions to generate GraphQL types!

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Person.class)
public interface PersonSimpleView {
    @IdMapping
    Long getId();
    String getName();
}
@EntityView(Cat.class)
public interface CatWithOwnerView {
    @IdMapping
    Long getId();
    String getName();
    PersonSimpleView getOwner();
}
----

<<<

* Integration with `graphql-java` project by using `GraphQLEntityViewSupport`
* In `DataFetcher` use `GraphQLEntityViewSupport` to create `EntityViewSetting`

[source,java]
----
GraphQLEntityViewSupport graphQLEntityViewSupport;

dataFetcher("findAll", new DataFetcher() {
    @Override
    public Object get(DataFetchingEnvironment dataFetchingEnvironment) {
        EntityViewSetting<CatWithOwnerView, ?> setting =
            graphQLEntityViewSupport.createPaginatedSetting(dataFetchingEnvironment);
        setting.addAttributeSorter("id", Sorters.ascending());
        if (setting.getMaxResults() == 0) {
            return new GraphQLRelayConnection<>(Collections.emptyList());
        }
        return new GraphQLRelayConnection<>(repository.findAll(setting));
    }
})
----

<<<

* The `GraphQLEntityViewSupport` is configurable to support custom names
* Relay support is not a must, you can also use an `offset` argument
* `GraphQLEntityViewSupport` also allows configuring custom names for pagination fields
* Use `GraphQLEntityViewSupport.createSetting` for non-paginated queries

[source,java]
----
GraphQLEntityViewSupport graphQLEntityViewSupport;

dataFetcher("findById", new DataFetcher() {
    @Override
    public Object get(DataFetchingEnvironment dataFetchingEnvironment) {
        return repository.findById(
            graphQLEntityViewSupport.createSetting(dataFetchingEnvironment),
            Long.valueOf(dataFetchingEnvironment.getArgument("id"))
        );
    }
})
----
<<<

* The big advantage of entity views is separation of business and projection logic
* Extracting the projection logic from GraphQL queries allows to reuse your existing logic

[source,java]
----
@Component
public class CatViewRepository {
    @Autowired EntityManager em;
    @Autowired CriteriaBuilderFactory cbf;
    @Autowired EntityViewManager evm;
    public <T> List<T> findAll(EntityViewSetting<T, ?> setting) {
        BlazeCriteriaQuery<Cat> cq = BlazeCriteria.get(cbf, Cat.class);
        // Your JPA Criteria logic
        Root<Cat> c = cq.from(Cat.class);
        cq.where(c.get(Cat_.DELETED).in(false));
        // Execute query with entity views driving projection logic
        return evm.applySetting(setting, cq.createCriteriaBuilder(em)).getResultList();
    }
}
----

== Blaze-Persistence Entity View GraphQL integration demo

// Notes
// create an entity view with a few aggregations and show how query changes
// graphql entity view relay spec pagination example and show how query changes
// Explain that GraphQL fetching is fully dependent no selection list

== Why use Blaze-Persistence Entity Views for GraphQL?

* Works on top of JPA, so reuse your models and knowledge
* Increase productivity and performance with keyset pagination support of Relay spec implementation
* Improve security and productivity as Entity Views provide abstraction layer
** Clearly define what properties are accessible
** Define computed properties via ad-hoc associations called _correlations_
** Type checked mappings during startup to avoid runtime surprises
* Fetch strategy on attribute definitions allows to fine tune performance
* Integration of selection list of GraphQL to only fetch and join data that was requested
* Allow to leave existing business logic untouched thanks to separation of projection logic

== Future improvements based on user demands

* Integration is pretty new, so there might be some things that can be improved
* Entity View Attribute filters
** Filter on attribute field name e.g. `name(where: "Ab%")`
** Filter on query level e.g. `findAll(where : {name: "Ab%"})`
** Maybe allow free form filters? `where: {name: {LIKE: "Ab%"}}`
* Entity View Attribute sorters
** Sort on attribute field name e.g. `name(orderBy: ASC)`
** What about multi-sort? Maybe generate enums for field names?
* No mutations integration yet, but looks we could map that to updatable entity vies
* Some users said cache directive integration we proposed would be awesome
