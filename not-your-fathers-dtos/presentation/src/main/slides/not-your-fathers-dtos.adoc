== What's a DTO again?

[, Wikipedia]
""
A data transfer object (DTO) is an object that carries data between processes.
""

* Reduce roundtrips and amount of data
* Simple objects without business logic
* No behavior, except for retrieval, serialization etc.

== What's wrong with DTOs with JPA?

* Some people say explicit DTOs are boilerplate and unnecessary

* If you don't care about performance that much, fetch the entity and use a Java mapper
** Dozer - Reflection based bean mapping
** Orika - Bean mapping with runtime bytecode spinning
** MapStruct - Bean mapping with compile time code generation
* MapStruct is great for simple Java-to-Java model mappings
* Though none of these tools help with adapting the query to fetch only necessary data

<<<

* All in all, doing the right thing usually requires a lot of code
* Modelling the write concern with explicit DTOs has similar issues
* Solutions usually rely on Lazy-Loading or Over-fetching data
* Because of this, people tend to avoid using explicit DTOs altogether
* When performance is negligible, just annotate entity model with e.g. `@JsonIgnore` etc.

* Or maybe just use the right tool for the job?

== Blaze-Persistence features

== What are Entity Views

image::dto-mapping.png[role="logo"]

Entity Views are the ORM equivalent of database views

* Built on top of Blaze-Persistence Core
* Define how DTO maps to entity via JPQL.next expressions
* Querying only the parts you need reduces data transfer
* Flushing only the parts that may change helps as well

Some example use cases:

* Display data in UI
* Fetch data to be returned in REST resources
* Define updatable attributes per use case

== What is Blaze-Persistence

image::logo.png[role="logo"]

* Library that builds on top of JPA with deep integration
* Fluent builder API that is easy to use
* Rich pagination support integrated
* Advanced SQL support on top of JPA model
** SET operations (`UNION`, `INTERSECT`, etc.)
** CTEs and recursive CTEs (`WITH` clause)
** `RETURNING` clause support
** `VALUES` clause and much more!

== Entity view mappings

Support for many more kinds of mappings

* Collections
** Remapping of collection types i.e. `Set` in entity as `List`
* Correlations
** Multiple mapping strategies for ad-hoc relations
* Inheritance
** Elegant mapping of JPA inheritance
** Custom selector based inheritance possible
* Use aggregations and let Blaze-Persistence figure out the `GROUP BY` for you
* Also support for filtering and sorting based on attributes!

== Entity view concepts

* Built around the idea of separating projections from the base query
* Allows to implement a base query without the knowledge of the projection
* Projection can be applied to any query node of a base query with proper type
* Allows for re-use of entity views, as well as base queries
* First define desired structure, then provide the mapping via JPQL.next expression
* Weaving the projection into a query requires a flexible query builder
* Blaze-Persistence Core resolves arbitrary depth path expressions `cat.kittens.owner.favoriteCat`

[canvas-image="images/arent-there-alternatives.jpg"]
== Aren't there alternatives

== Entity view alternatives

* Hibernate proprietary `@Immutable` entity with use of `@Formula`
** Has it's limits and is SQL based rather than JPQL/HQL based
** Requires copying mappings which is painful for collections
** No syntax validation in mappings on startup
** Hibernate fetch strategies only work with `entityManager.find` or `Hibernate.initialize`
* Roll your own JPQL + mapper
** Requires a lot of effort to get right for all cases
* Spring Data Projections
** Only good for simple cases, doesn't support complex mapping

== Entity view advantages

* Use JPQL.next expressions for projections instead of SQL
* Mappings are validated against JPA-model on startup
* No more lazy loading or accidental N + 1 queries issues
* Performance problems can be handled by adapting attribute fetch strategies
** Strategies: `JOIN` (default), batched `SELECT` or `SUBSELECT`
** Fetch strategies like Hibernate, but work with any base query, not just by id
* Domain specific abstraction over persistence model
* First class filter and sorting support for entity views
* Combine with advanced features provided by Blaze-Persistence Core(CTEs, etc.)

== Speechless?

[canvas-image="images/demo-time.jpg"]
== Angular demo

// Show example with Angular and keyset pagination? => Filter and sorter on attributes via EntityViewSettingProcessor

== Entity views for reporting

* Are your reporting queries complex and is writing the `GROUP BY` clause a pain?
* Entity views can help, thanks to _implicit group by generation_

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatReportView {

    Long getId();
    String getName();
    @Mapping("AVG(kittens.age)")
    double getAvgKittenAge();
}
----

[source,java]

<<<

* _Implicit group by generation_ is provided by Blaze-Persistence Core

[canvas-image="images/do-i-have-to-rewrite-code.jpg"]
== Should I rewrite my JPA Criteria code

== Keep your existing JPA Criteria code

* No need to throw away all your existing code
* Blaze-Persistence comes with a JPA Criteria API implementation
* Has a few extensions like e.g. entity joins
* Will add new extensions as the need arises
* Produces a Blaze-Persistence Core query builder
* Harness advanced features even for legacy queries
* Stick with JPA Criteria API if you like it

<<<

* Use an entity view on top of a JPA Criteria query

[source,java]
----
// Create criteria query object with BlazeCriteria
BlazeCriteriaQuery<Cat> query = BlazeCriteria.get(criteriaBuilderFactory, Cat.class);
BlazeCriteriaBuilder cb = query.getCriteriaBuilder();

// Business as usual, just your important business logic
Root<Cat> cat = query.from(Cat.class);
query.where(cb.gt(cat.get(Cat_.age), 18));

// Create the Core query builder and apply the entity view to it
CriteriaBuilder<Cat> coreBuilder = query.createCriteriaBuilder(entityManager);
List<CatView> result = entityViewManager.applySetting(
  coreBuilder,
  EntityViewSetting.create(CatView.class)
).getResultList();
----

== What about the write concern

* So far, only presented how the read part works i.e. how to get data out
* But DTOs are also useful or sometimes necessary for getting data in
* Entity model often not suitable to hold partial data
* An entity type might allow setting fields that shouldn't be set in a use case
* Using entity model for read concern isn't good because of problems with lazy loading
* Using entity model for write concern is bad because one might set fields that aren't considered
* Mere possibility of doing something that isn't intended is problematic

<<<

* Ever accidently set an attribute that was `updatable = false`?

org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: could not initialize proxy - no Session
----

<<<

* Using plain JPA for the domain model or DTO model works out pretty well
* Encapsulate everything by using field access and protect data
* But there are limitations that you have to know
** Id access of proxy instance initializes object
** No guarantee that models match when having multiple domain models
** Dirty tracking just started working properly in recent Hibernate versions
** Even with dirty tracking, `merge` first loads from DB before flushing updates
** Optimizations for immutable entities are Hibernate proprietary
** Filtering on unmapped columns has to be done with Hibernate filters

[canvas-image="images/enter-updatable-entity-views.jpg"]
== Enter updatable entity views

== Updatable entity views

* Like normal entity views, but can flush changes back
* Extensive startup validation will inform you about mistakes early
* Encourages clean domain driven design with proper encapsulation
* Updatable entity views require a shift in thinking
* Update operations always start at the aggregate root
* When modelling a use case, start with aggregate root
* Usually, there is only a single aggregate root per transaction

== Why updatable entity views

* Write model DTOs per use-case allows easier understanding and efficient read/update
* Optimistic and pessimistic locking support for write model DTOs
* Handles all the fancy stuff like collections, subviews etc.
* Automatic inverse relationship management
* Supports custom cascade deletes and also orphan removal
* Implements the most efficient remove by id support with proper cascading
* Amazing Spring Data and pretty good DeltaSpike Data integration

<<<

* Thanks to dirty tracking, allows API for inspecting actual changes
* Handles primary key based equality properly
* Good performance because of dirty tracking
** Can do direct updates without loading data first with query strategy
** Can do efficient fine-grained locking
** Can pre-load the exact entity graph that is needed for an update
** Preserving of "logical collection operations" to avoid expensive "CollectionRecreateEvent"
** Implements index translation optimization to improve indexed list performance

== Updatable entity views - Basic

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
@UpdatableEntityView
public interface CatUpdateView {

    @IdMapping
    Integer getId();

    String getName();
    void setName(String name);
}
----

* Simply invoke `EntityViewManager.update()` on updatable entity view

[source,java]
----
CatUpdateView cat = ...
cat.setName("newName");

entityViewManager.update(entityManager, cat);
----

== Updatable entity views

* Flush modes as required by your use case
** Lazy - Flush updatable if one owned attribute is dirty
** Partial - Only flush what actually changed
** Full - Always flush all updatable attributes
* Query flush strategy is default that avoids loading data
* Entity flush strategy loads dirty part of graph for updates
* Using `entityManager.merge` is roughly equivalent to lazy entity flushing
* Lazy query flushing is the most efficient and also the default
* Also, if nothing is dirty, nothing happens on `EntityViewManager.update()`

== Updatable entity views - Subview & Collection

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
@UpdatableEntityView
public interface CatUpdateView {

    @IdMapping
    Integer getId();

    @UpdatableMapping
    Set<CatIdView> getKittens();
}
----

* Adding existing cat to kittens will only do an insert into the join table

[source,java]
----
CatUpdateView cat = ...
cat.getKittens().add(entityViewManager.getReference(CatIdView.class, catId));
----

== Creatable entity views

* We distinguish between creatable and updatable entity views
* Creation often requires setting additional attributes

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
@CreatableEntityView
public interface CatCreateView {

    @IdMapping
    Integer getId();

    PersonIdView getOwner();
    void setOwner(PersonIdView owner);
}
----

* Changing owner later is a dedicated use case that deserves its own entity view

<<<

* Creating new instances of creatable entity view via

[source,java]
----
CatCreateView cat = entityViewManager.create(CatCreateView.class);
----

* Invokes `@PostCreate` method defined in creatable entity view

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Cat.class)
@CreatableEntityView
public interface CatCreateView {
    @PostCreate default void init() {
        // set default values
    }
}
----

<<<

* Startup validation ensures a creatable entity view is _persistable_ based on non-null attributes
* Flushing creatable entity views always happens via `EntityManager.persist()`
* Currently, attributes that should only be settable in a service have to be mapped
* Pre-persist entity view listeners is about to come to Blaze-Persistence 1.4 to handle that

[source,java]
----
CatCreateView cat = ...
entityViewManager.updateWith(entityManager, cat)
    .onPrePersist(CatCreateView.class, Cat.class, (evm, em, v, entity) -> {
        entity.setOwner(loggedInOwner);
    })
    .flush();
----

* On flush, sets generated identifiers on the entity view

== Updatable entity views - Spring Data

* Using updatable or creatable entity views with Spring Data is easy

[source,java]
----
@UpdatableEntityView
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatModificationView {
    @IdMapping
    Integer getId();
}

@CreatableEntityView
@EntityView(Cat.class)
interface CatCreateView extends CatModificationView {
    //...
}

interface CatRepository extends Repository<Cat, Integer> {
    CatModificationView save(CatModificationView cat);
}
----

== Updatable entity views - ChangeModel API

* Ever wanted to present a user what actually changed or generate audit info?
* The ChangeModel API is here to help you access the dirty state

[source,java]
----
CatUpdateView cat = ...
cat.setName("newName");
SingularChangeModel<CatUpdateView> c = entityViewManager.getChangeModel(cat);
c.isDirty(); // true
c.get("name").isDirty(); // true
c.get("name").getInitialState(); // the old value
c.get("name").getCurrentState(); // "newName"

* The need for DTOs arose which was implemented with `@SqlResultSetMapping`
* Quickly became overwhelming as entities were full of mappings

Spring Data Projections didn't work for them since it's limited to entity attributes

[source,java]
----
interface CustomerDetails {

    Long getId();

    String getName();

    // can't map orderCount nor avgOrder!

}

* Lack of JPA standard support for CTE eventually lead search to Blaze-Persistence
* Switching domain model to Entity Views was a game changer for the project

Adopting Entity Views helped me overcome all the compromises I had to accept before and
speed-up the performance of my repositories in a way I never imagined!

<<<

Cumbersome mapping and querying was replaced with a simple Entity View

[source,java]
----
@EntityView(Customer.class)
interface CustomerDetails {

    Long getId();

    String getName();

    @Mapping("COUNT(orders)")
    long getOrderCount();

    @Mapping("AVG(orders.amount)")
    double getAvgOrder();

}
----

<<<

With the Spring Data integration, consuming this is as simple as

[source,java]
----
interface CustomerRepository extends JpaRepository<Customer, Long> {

    CustomerDetails findByName(String name);

}

<<<

Simple stuff looks simple, but what about the complex CTE queries?

  TicketAggregateView getTicketAggregates();

  interface TicketAggregateView {

And this is just the start, Blaze-Persistence is maintained daily with bug fixes
and new features, with a rich roadmap and exhaustive documentation. I really
look forward to the next releases and upcoming features, to continue to improve
my code and my domain model.

== Curecomp Linz, Austria

image::curecomp.png[width=300, role = "logo"]

* Clevercure SRM is completely built on top of Blaze-Persistence
* Domain models are entity views that completely encapsulate the JPA model
* Using all the fancy advanced features to improve performance
* Started out as simple utility to be able to provide fetches externally
* Filter, sorting and pagination requirements lead to develop Blaze-Persistence Core
* Deficiencies of JPQL constructor expression lead to developing entity views
* Ever since extended Blaze-Persistence to handle new requirements efficiently
* Developer productivity increased significantly and designs are more domain driven

* Jan-Willem Gmeilig Meyling is lead developer at Pallas Athena Group
* Project AthenaStudies for organizing tutoring and extracurricular courses
* Expanding portfolio lead to new query performance challenges that required advanced SQL
* Wasn't using the DBMS features that were appropriate, because of lacking JPQL-support
* Was in desperate need for recursive CTEs to implement loading a tree efficiently
* Blaze-Persistence recursive CTE support came to the rescue
* Combines the power of recursive CTEs with entity views for data scoping
